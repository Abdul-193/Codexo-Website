# Codexo-Website

A simple static website for Codexo with experimental React components.

## Development

Open `index.html` in your browser to view the site. The page bootstraps a small React application under `src/`.

React components such as `Homepage`, `Projekte`, and the layout live in the `src` folder. A minimal `package.json` is provided so `npm test` runs without errors (no tests are currently configured).
